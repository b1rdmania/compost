## The Aesthetic

[Paragraph 1: Foundation. What visual idea drives everything? What emotion should surfaces convey? Anchor this in a metaphor or cultural touchpoint.]

[Paragraph 2: Space and structure. How do elements relate to each other? Angular precision or organic flow? Does white space breathe or compress? Describe the compositional logic.]

[Paragraph 3: Color and substance. What governs the palette? Is warmth or coolness dominant? Does color signal meaning or decoration? What real-world materials does this reference? Define the chromatic language.]

[Paragraph 4: Letterforms. What personality does type express? Engineered precision or approachable warmth? How does scale create emphasis — through proportion, density, or position? What does the text reveal about brand character?]

[Paragraph 5: Tempo and density. How much lives on each screen? Does the eye dart or rest? Is the experience efficient and packed or measured and contemplative? Define the information architecture philosophy.]

[Paragraph 6: Precision. The final execution must look labored over — the work of someone at the peak of their discipline. Every alignment considered, every value chosen deliberately, every relationship calibrated. Nothing accidental.]

## At a Glance

| Dimension | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| **Space** | [Usage — e.g., "Layered planes, considered negative space"] |
| **Shape** | [Language — e.g., "Clean geometry with subtle rounding"] |
| **Palette** | [Strategy — e.g., "Subdued base, purposeful accent"] |
| **Type** | [System — e.g., "Sans for interface, mono for data, weight-based hierarchy"] |
| **Surface** | [Quality — e.g., "Implied depth without overt texture"] |
| **Tempo** | [Density — e.g., "Practical information load, no filler"] |
| **Animation** | [Philosophy — e.g., "Meaningful transitions only"] |

## The Experience

[One paragraph on the emotional response this visual language should trigger. What does it feel like to encounter something built in this system?]
