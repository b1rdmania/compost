# Worst-Case Playbook

What happens if things go wrong, and how we respond.

---

## Scenario 1: Token Dumps

**Trigger:** $COMPOST price drops 50%+ from TGE.

### Immediate actions

| Action | Timeline |
|--------|----------|
| Pause new gauge approvals | Immediate |
| Reduce emission rate (if governance allows) | 24-48h |
| Public comms explaining situation | Same day |

### What we do NOT do

- No treasury dumps to "defend" price
- No panic liquidity pulls
- No hiding from the community

### Communication

> "Token price is market-driven. cHYPE yield is product-driven. The vault continues to generate yield regardless of token price. We're focused on product, not price."

### Recovery path

- Focus all resources on cHYPE APR
- Let emissions attract long-term believers at lower prices
- Token recovery follows product success

---

## Scenario 2: AUM Drawdown

**Trigger:** AUM drops 30%+ over 30 days.

### Immediate actions

| Action | Timeline |
|--------|----------|
| Review withdrawal queue for anomalies | Immediate |
| Rebalance to increase liquidity buffer | 24-48h |
| Assess if drawdown is market-wide or Compost-specific | 48h |

### If Compost-specific

| Root cause | Response |
|------------|----------|
| Competitor offering better yield | Match or differentiate on risk/composability |
| Trust issue / exploit concern | Transparent audit + comms |
| General DeFi rotation | Wait it out, maintain product quality |

### Communication

> "We're seeing outflows. Here's what's causing it: [X]. Here's what we're doing: [Y]. Vault remains solvent, redemptions processing normally."

### Financial impact

- Management fee revenue drops proportionally
- Reduce team burn if needed (see runway section)
- Do NOT cut product/security resources

---

## Scenario 3: APR Below Hurdle

**Trigger:** Vault yield falls below HYPE staking rate for 30+ days.

### What this means

- No performance fee accrues
- Only management fee (0.5% on HIP-3 sleeve)
- Stakers would earn more on vanilla HYPE staking

### Immediate actions

| Action | Timeline |
|--------|----------|
| Identify which HIP-3 strategies are underperforming | Immediate |
| Rebalance toward better-performing strategies | 1 week |
| Consider increasing validator allocation (baseline yield) | 1 week |
| Transparent reporting to stakers | Weekly |

### If prolonged (90+ days)

| Option | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| Increase validator % to guarantee baseline | May reduce upside |
| Exit underperforming HIP-3 positions | Subject to unlock periods |
| Communicate honestly about market conditions | Always |

### Communication

> "Current vault yield is below HYPE staking. This means no performance fee is being charged. We're [rebalancing / waiting for Growth Mode to end / adjusting allocations]. You can redeem anytime."

---

## Scenario 4: Growth Mode Persists

**Trigger:** HIP-3 markets remain in Growth Mode (90% fee reduction) for 6+ months.

### Impact

- Builder fee yield is ~10% of normal
- Vault yield may be 3-4% instead of 8-10%
- Stakers question value proposition

### Response

| Action | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Be honest about Growth Mode impact | Update docs + comms |
| Emphasize positioning for when fees normalize | Long-term thesis |
| Consider $COMPOST emission boosts | Maintain TVL via incentives |
| Do NOT promise yield that depends on fee mode changes | Avoid legal risk |

### Communication

> "HIP-3 markets are in Growth Mode, reducing builder fees. Current yield is [X]%. When markets transition to Standard Mode, fees increase 10x. We're positioned for that transition."

---

## Scenario 5: Token Launch Decision Point

**Trigger:** Approaching planned TGE but conditions are unfavorable.

### Unfavorable conditions

- cHYPE APR < 5%
- AUM < $25M
- Market sentiment bearish
- Major competitor launching same week

### Circuit breaker

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| APR < 5% for 30+ days | Delay TGE |
| AUM < $25M | Delay TGE |
| Active security incident | Cancel until resolved |
| Regulatory uncertainty | Legal review before proceeding |

### Communication

> "We're delaying the $COMPOST launch to ensure conditions are right for long-term success. cHYPE continues to operate normally. Points continue to accrue."

### What we protect

- Do NOT launch a token that will dump and damage brand
- Do NOT force tokenomics onto a weak product
- Token is optional — cHYPE is the core product

---

## Runway & Operations

### Pre-TGE burn rate

| Item | Monthly |
|------|---------|
| Team (founder + 1-2) | $25-30K |
| Infra (RPC, monitoring, legal) | $5-10K |
| Total | ~$35-40K |

### Runway sources

| Source | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Pre-seed / angel | TBD |
| Management fee at $50M AUM | ~$10K/mo |
| Management fee at $100M AUM | ~$20K/mo |

### Break-even

- At $100M+ AUM: near break-even on management fee alone
- Performance fee is upside for treasury + ops

### If runway runs low

| Action | Priority |
|--------|----------|
| Reduce team to founder-only | Last resort |
| Pause marketing spend | Early cut |
| Seek strategic investment | If product metrics strong |
| Do NOT sell treasury tokens at distressed prices | |

## Communication Principles

1. **Be first** — Don't let others define the narrative
2. **Be honest** — Acknowledge problems directly
3. **Be specific** — "Here's what happened, here's what we're doing"
4. **Be consistent** — Same message across all channels
5. **Separate token from product** — cHYPE yield is real; token is governance + incentives
