# Allocation

How Compost allocates capital across markets.

## How Capital Is Allocated

Compost allocates capital through three channels:

### 1. Validator Staking (20-30% of vault)

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Purpose | Liquidity buffer for redemptions |
| Yield | ~2.5% APY base |
| Queue | 7-day unstake |

Provides consistent base yield while maintaining liquidity.

---

### 2. Partner Allocations (50-70% of vault)

Direct arrangements with HIP-3 deployers.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Fee share | Typically 20-40% of trading fees |
| Terms | Vary by partner and allocation size |
| Advantage | Compost's scale enables better terms than retail |

**Current Partners:** TBC

---

### 3. Direct Deployment (0% initially)

Compost deploys its own HIP-3 market.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Fee share | 50% (protocol-enforced) |
| Requirement | 500K HYPE minimum + operator responsibility |
| Status | Under evaluation for Phase 2+ |

Future consideration once scale and operations justify the capital commitment.
