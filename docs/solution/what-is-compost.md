# What is Compost?

**The short version:** Compost lets you earn yield from Hyperliquid's builder markets without needing $15 million.

## The Opportunity

Hyperliquid's HIP-3 markets are generating real revenue right now. Deployers earn 50% of all trading fees — and volume is in the billions.

But to deploy a market, you need to stake 500K HYPE (~$20M). That locks out almost everyone.

**Compost solves this.** We pool capital together, deploy across multiple markets, and share the yield with depositors.

## How It Works

<div style="display: grid; gap: 16px; margin: 24px 0;">
  <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 16px;">
    <img src="/icons/deposit.svg" alt="" style="width: 36px; height: 36px;" />
    <div><strong>1. You deposit HYPE</strong> — any amount</div>
  </div>
  <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 16px;">
    <img src="/icons/token.svg" alt="" style="width: 36px; height: 36px;" />
    <div><strong>2. You get cHYPE</strong> — a token that represents your share</div>
  </div>
  <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 16px;">
    <img src="/icons/allocate.svg" alt="" style="width: 36px; height: 36px;" />
    <div><strong>3. We allocate</strong> your HYPE across vetted HIP-3 markets</div>
  </div>
  <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 16px;">
    <img src="/icons/yield.svg" alt="" style="width: 36px; height: 36px;" />
    <div><strong>4. Yield flows in</strong> from trading fees and staking</div>
  </div>
  <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 16px;">
    <img src="/icons/chart.svg" alt="" style="width: 36px; height: 36px;" />
    <div><strong>5. Your cHYPE grows</strong> in value as yield compounds</div>
  </div>
  <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 16px;">
    <img src="/icons/withdraw.svg" alt="" style="width: 36px; height: 36px;" />
    <div><strong>6. You withdraw</strong> whenever you want</div>
  </div>
</div>

No minimum. No lock-up. No complexity.

## Why It Matters

| Before Compost | With Compost |
|----------------|--------------|
| Need $20M to participate | Deposit any amount |
| Pick markets yourself | Professional selection |
| Single market risk | Diversified exposure |
| Manage everything | Set and forget |
| Illiquid position | Tradeable cHYPE token |

---

## One Token: cHYPE

When you deposit, you receive **cHYPE**. That's it.

- It tracks your share of the vault
- It appreciates as yield accrues
- You can trade it, use it as collateral, or just hold it

No points. No complexity. Just yield.
