# What is Compost?

**The short version:** Compost lets you earn yield from Hyperliquid's builder markets without needing $15 million.

---

## The Opportunity

Hyperliquid's HIP-3 markets are generating real revenue right now. Deployers earn 50% of all trading fees — and volume is in the billions.

But to deploy a market, you need to stake 500K HYPE (~$15M). That locks out almost everyone.

**Compost solves this.** We pool capital together, deploy across multiple markets, and share the yield with depositors.

## How It Works

Think of it like this:

1. **You deposit HYPE** — any amount
2. **You get cHYPE** — a token that represents your share
3. **We allocate** your HYPE across vetted HIP-3 markets
4. **Yield flows in** from trading fees and staking
5. **Your cHYPE grows** in value as yield compounds
6. **You withdraw** whenever you want

No minimum. No lock-up. No complexity.

## Why It Matters

| Before Compost | With Compost |
|----------------|--------------|
| Need $15M to participate | Deposit any amount |
| Pick markets yourself | Professional selection |
| Single market risk | Diversified exposure |
| Manage everything | Set and forget |
| Illiquid position | Tradeable cHYPE token |

---

## One Token: cHYPE

When you deposit, you receive **cHYPE**. That's it.

- It tracks your share of the vault
- It appreciates as yield accrues
- You can trade it, use it as collateral, or just hold it

No governance token. No points. No complexity. Just yield.
