# What is Compost?

Compost is the capital formation layer for Hyperliquid builder markets.

We aggregate capital into a single vault, allocate across vetted HIP-3 markets, and pass through yield to depositors.

---

## How It Works

1. **Deposit HYPE** into the vault
2. **Receive cHYPE** — your receipt token
3. **Vault allocates** capital across HIP-3 markets and validator staking
4. **Yield accrues** to the vault from builder fees and staking rewards
5. **cHYPE appreciates** as yield compounds
6. **Withdraw anytime** — 14-day queue or sell on secondary market

## The Value Proposition

| Without Compost | With Compost |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Need $15M to deploy | Any amount of HYPE |
| Single market exposure | Diversified across markets |
| Pick operators yourself | Professional vetting |
| Manage positions | Set and forget |
| Illiquid | Tradeable cHYPE |

## One Token

**cHYPE** is your receipt token. It represents your share of the vault.

- Appreciates as yield accrues
- Composable across DeFi
- Tradeable on secondary markets

No governance token. No points. Just yield.
