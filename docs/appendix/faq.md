## Deposits & Withdrawals

### How do I deposit?

Connect wallet → Approve HYPE → Deposit → Receive cHYPE

### How do I withdraw?

Two options:
1. **Protocol redemption:** Burn cHYPE → 14-day queue → Receive HYPE
2. **Secondary market:** Sell cHYPE on DEX for instant exit

## Fees

### What are the fees?

15% of yield. No deposit or withdrawal fees.

Continuously, as yield accrues. Deducted before compounding into vault.

---

## Yield

### Where does yield come from?

1. Validator staking (~2.5% base)
2. HIP-3 builder fees (variable, 20-50%+)
3. Token incentives (treasury, funds operations)

### What's the expected APY?

Variable. Depends on:
- HIP-3 fee generation
- Allocation efficiency
- Growth Mode status of markets

We don't project APY. Check actual yield on the dashboard.

## Risk

### What if a market gets slashed?

Diversification limits exposure. No single market >25% of vault. Losses are absorbed pro-rata by all cHYPE holders.

### Is it audited?

Audit in progress. Report will be published before mainnet launch.

### Who manages allocations?

Compost team with oversight from an independent advisory committee. All allocations are published.

### Can I use cHYPE in DeFi?

Yes. cHYPE is composable:

Held in treasury and sold periodically to fund operations. Does not affect cHYPE yield directly.
