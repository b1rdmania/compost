# The Problem Compost Solves

If you have $15M, you can deploy a market and earn 50% of fees.

If you don't, your options are fragmented.

---

## Current Options

| Option | Problem |
|--------|---------|
| Use pooled/wrapper programs | Their pools, their terms, limited markets |
| Buy deployer tokens | Single-market exposure, token risk |
| Direct arrangements with operators | Requires relationship, negotiation |
| Watch from sidelines | Miss the opportunity entirely |

---

## What's Missing

There's no simple way to get **diversified exposure** to HIP-3 yield.

You either:
- Have $15M and deploy yourself
- Accept fragmented, single-market exposure
- Don't participate
