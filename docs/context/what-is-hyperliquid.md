## Key Metrics

## Architecture

Hyperliquid isn't a fork. It's purpose-built infrastructure:

### HyperBFT Consensus
Custom Layer 1 blockchain optimised for trading performance.

### HyperCore
Native order book — not an AMM, a real order book with limit orders, market orders, and proper price-time priority.

### HyperEVM
EVM-compatible smart contract layer for DeFi composability.

## Why It Matters

The combination of:
- **Speed** — Sub-200ms execution
- **Liquidity** — $9.6B open interest
- **Composability** — EVM compatibility

...creates the foundation for new financial primitives.

In October 2025, Hyperliquid launched one of these primitives: **HIP-3**.
