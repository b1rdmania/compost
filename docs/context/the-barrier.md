# The Barrier

To deploy a HIP-3 market, you must stake 500K HYPE.

At $30/HYPE, that's **~$15 million**.

---

## Why So High?

This isn't a bug. It's a security mechanism.

| Purpose | How It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| Skin in the game | Deployers have significant capital at risk |
| Slashing | Stake can be slashed for malicious behaviour |
| Accountability | Creates responsibility without centralised gatekeepers |
| Quality filter | Only serious operators deploy markets |

---

## Slashing Conditions

Deployer stake can be slashed for:

- **Bad oracles** — Manipulated or stale price feeds
- **Market manipulation** — Coordinated attacks on traders
- **Parameter abuse** — Malicious leverage or margin settings

---

## The Problem

The $15M barrier ensures quality but creates a problem:

**It locks out most participants from the best yield opportunity in crypto right now.**

Even if you believe in HIP-3, even if you want exposure to builder market yield — the barrier is too high for almost everyone.
