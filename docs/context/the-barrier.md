# The Barrier

HIP-3 markets offer some of the best yield in crypto right now. But there's a catch.

---

## The $15M Problem

To deploy a HIP-3 market, you must stake **500,000 HYPE**.

At current prices, that's roughly **$15 million**.

This isn't a bug — it's by design. Hyperliquid requires deployers to have serious skin in the game. It filters out bad actors and ensures market quality.

But it also means **almost everyone is locked out** of this opportunity.

## Who Can Actually Participate?

| Player | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Retail investors | Locked out |
| Most funds | Locked out |
| Whales with $15M+ | Can deploy solo |
| Well-funded teams | Can build their own markets |

Even if you believe in HIP-3, even if you want exposure to builder market yield — the capital requirement is simply too high for almost everyone.

## Why the High Barrier?

It's a security mechanism:

- **Skin in the game** — Deployers have significant capital at risk
- **Accountability** — Creates responsibility without centralised gatekeepers
- **Quality filter** — Only serious operators deploy markets

The stake can be slashed for malicious behaviour (bad oracles, market manipulation, parameter abuse). This protects traders but raises the bar for participation.
