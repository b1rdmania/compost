## Growth Mode

::: warning
**Note on fees:** Most markets currently operate in "Growth Mode" — a 90% fee reduction to bootstrap volume. As markets mature and Growth Mode ends, fee rates will normalise to standard levels (~4.5 bps taker), significantly increasing yield.

## The Math

At standard fee rates with current volume:

```
$25B volume × 4.5 bps = $11.25M in fees
50% to deployers = $5.6M to builders
```

In Growth Mode (90% fee reduction), the same volume implies:

```
$25B volume × 0.45 bps = $1.125M in fees
50% to deployers = $0.56M to builders
```

This is real yield. Protocol-enforced. Already happening — but **fee modes matter** for near-term yield.
