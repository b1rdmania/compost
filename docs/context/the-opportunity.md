## Growth Mode

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note on fees:** Most markets currently operate in "Growth Mode" — a 90% fee reduction to bootstrap volume. As markets mature and Growth Mode ends, fee rates will normalise to standard levels (~4.5 bps taker), significantly increasing yield.
{% endhint %}

## The Math

At standard fee rates with current volume:

```
$25B volume × 4.5 bps = $11.25M in fees
50% to deployers = $5.6M to builders
```

This is real yield. Protocol-enforced. Already happening.
