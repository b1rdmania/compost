# What is HIP-3?

HIP-3 (Hyperliquid Improvement Proposal 3) enables permissionless deployment of perpetual futures markets.

---

## How It Works

Anyone who stakes **500K HYPE** can deploy their own market on Hyperliquid's infrastructure.

The deployer chooses:
- Asset (equities, commodities, FX, crypto, custom indices)
- Oracle source
- Leverage limits
- Risk parameters

Hyperliquid handles:
- Order matching
- Settlement
- Risk management

## What Can Be Listed

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Equities | Tesla, Nvidia, indices |
| Commodities | Gold, silver |
| FX pairs | EUR/USD, GBP/USD |
| Pre-IPO | SpaceX, OpenAI, Anthropic |
| Crypto | Any token with a reliable oracle |
| Custom | Indices, baskets, structured products |

## The Economics

Deployers receive **50% of all trading fees** their market generates.

This is protocol-enforced — not discretionary, not a promise. **Code.**

The other 50% goes to Hyperliquid (protocol fees, HYPE buybacks).

## Fee Structure

| Recipient | Share |
|-----------|-------|
| Deployer | 50% |
| Hyperliquid protocol | 50% |

Standard fee rate: ~4.5 bps taker (though many markets currently operate in Growth Mode with reduced fees).
