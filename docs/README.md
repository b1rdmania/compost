# Compost Finance

The capital formation layer for Hyperliquid builder markets.

## What is Compost?

Compost aggregates capital into a single vault, allocates across vetted HIP-3 markets, and passes through yield to depositors.

**One token. Diversified exposure. No $20M minimum.**

---

## Quick Start

1. **Deposit HYPE** → Receive cHYPE (your receipt token)
2. **Vault allocates** → Capital goes to vetted HIP-3 markets + validator staking
3. **Yield accrues** → cHYPE appreciates as yield compounds
4. **Withdraw anytime** → 14-day queue or sell on secondary market
